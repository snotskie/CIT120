Kids on Bikes is a collaborative storytelling game that allows players to take on the roles of ordinary kids or teenagers in a small town setting. It was developed by Jonathan Gilmour and Doug Levandowski and published by Renegade Game Studios.In Kids on Bikes, players can create their own characters with unique abilities, skills, and backgrounds. The game emphasizes storytelling and encourages players to work together to solve mysteries, uncover secrets, and face supernatural or mysterious events happening in their town. It draws inspiration from popular TV shows and movies like Stranger Things, The Goonies, and E.T., capturing the sense of adventure, exploration, and camaraderie among young protagonists.The game mechanics of Kids on Bikes are designed to be simple and accessible, focusing on narrative-driven gameplay rather than complex rules. It utilizes a dice pool system, where players roll multiple six-sided dice (d6) and add the relevant attribute or skill to determine their level of success. The outcome of the dice roll helps to shape the story and resolve conflicts or challenges.Kids on Bikes provides a framework for Game Masters (referred to as the \"Game Moderator\" in this system) to create engaging and mysterious adventures for the players. The system encourages improvisation and collaboration, allowing both players and the moderator to contribute to the unfolding narrative.Overall, Kids on Bikes offers a fun and imaginative role-playing experience that captures the essence of classic coming-of-age tales with a touch of supernatural or otherworldly elements.Me: Write a Python script to calculate a random Stat Check for Kids on Bike, given a die size, a bonus value, and the difficulty of the rollChatGPT: Certainly!

Then, it compares stat_check with the difficulty to determine whether the check was successful or not.Finally, an example usage is shown, where the die_size is set to 6, the bonus is set to 2, and the difficulty is set to 10. The script calculates the stat check and prints the result and whether the check was successful or not.Feel free to adjust the values of die_size, bonus, and difficulty according to your specific needs.Me: That will not work. Kids on Bikes has an exploding die mechanic. Are you familiar with it?ChatGPT: Apologies for the oversight. Yes, I'm familiar with the exploding die mechanic in Kids on Bikes. In this system, if the highest possible value is rolled on the die (e.g., a 6 on a six-sided die), the die is rolled again, and the new result is added to the previous roll. This process continues as long as the highest possible value is rolled.Here's an updated version of the Python script that incorporates the exploding die mechanic:","category":"page"},{"location":"journal03/","page":"Reading / Journal 3","title":"Reading / Journal 3","text":"import random\n\ndef calculate_stat_check(die_size, bonus, difficulty):\n    stat_check = 0\n    while True:\n        roll = random.randint(1, die_size)\n        stat_check += roll\n        if roll < die_size:\n            break\n    \n    stat_check += bonus\n    success = stat_check >= difficulty\n    return stat_check, success\n\n# Example usage\ndie_size = 6\nbonus = 2\ndifficulty = 10\n\nstat_check_result, success_result = calculate_stat_check(die_size, bonus, difficulty)\n\nprint(f\"Stat Check Result: {stat_check_result}\")\nprint(f\"Success: {success_result}\")","category":"page"},{"location":"journal03/","page":"Reading / Journal 3","title":"Reading / Journal 3","text":"In this updated script, the calculate_stat_check function uses a while loop to simulate the exploding die mechanic. It repeatedly rolls the die (using random.randint(1, die_size)) and adds the result to the stat_check variable. The loop continues as long as the rolled value is the highest possible value on the die.Once the loop terminates (when a non-maximum value is rolled), the bonus is added to the stat_check, and the result is compared to the difficulty to determine success.Again, you can modify the values of die_size, bonus, and difficulty to suit your requirements.","category":"page"},{"location":"journal03/","page":"Reading / Journal 3","title":"Reading / Journal 3","text":"This code is close, but still incorrect, since the player should stop \"exploding\" if they've already rolled enough to succeed.

They had written everything themselves, so I was able to ask questions to help clarify what things were supposed to be doing and why they chose to do it the way they did. Now, people come in with pages of code all written by AI. This is much harder to diagnose, since (a) any part of it could be at fault, (b) multiple parts could be interacting in misunderstood ways, or (c) the whole thing could be approaching the researcher's actual purpose in a wrong or weird way.
