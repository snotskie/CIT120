# Project Check-in 5

## Like a Final Draft ☑️

In the last check-in, you continued to flesh out your primer on your language. In this check-in, we wrap that up and submit a "final-like" draft for peer review.

## Fifth Check-in

To get feedback from other students and to compare where you are to where they are, and to compare your language to their language, we're moving into the Peer Review activity following this check-in. That, and making for-real-final revisions, make up the bulk of what's left in the course.

So let's get ready for that:

First, look back over your project as-is. Did you decide to do a Word document or a Powerpoint? If you are doing a Word document, how are you using headings, bold font, bullets, etc. to make the "outline" of the document clear to the reader? If you are doing a Powerpoint, is the information on each slide brief but accurate, and are you putting two or more types of media on a single slide? (Having definition *and* the example on the same slide in the past has led to screenshots being either distorted or too small to read.)

Second, where do you stand on each of the following topics? Which of those topics is your strongest and presented the strongest in your document? (Do you believe you have successfully defined the topic in general, given an example in your language to illustrate that definition, and the example is clear, easy to read, and syntax highlighted?)

- **History** of your language
- **Documentation** on your language that is official and easy for beginners
- **Getting Started** instructions, brief but informative, showing someone how to go from zero knowledge to everything they need to install and setup to a working "hello world" example on their own computer (not on repl.it)
- **Data Types** supported by and commonly seen in your language
- **Variables** and how to declare them in your language
- **Conversion** between common data types in your language, like string to int
- **Console I/O** for showing text to the user and getting a response back
- **If/Else** in your language
- **While** loops in your language
- **For** loops in your language
- **Arrays** in your language
- **Functions** in your language
- **Classes** in your language

Third, make any revisions you believe you have left to do. Remember, this should be like a final draft. It should *not* be a long paper. The goal is that you put together a "primer" on your assigned language as it relates to all our course concepts, with clear explanation and legible examples. No more, no less. The coding examples you give in your document should be ones you've written yourself.

Finally, submit a copy to me as usual, and a copy to the Peer Review discussion board. Next week you'll give and get feedback with your peers, and the week after that you can reflect on your feedback with your Studio group as we start to bring the course to a close.

## Submission

Submit TWO copies, one to me (through the usual Blackboard link) and one to the Peer Review discussion board. That way I can give you private feedback, and your peers can give you feedback during the Peer Review activity.

## Grading

This check-in is worth 3/100 towards your final grade.
