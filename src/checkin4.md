# Project Check-in 4

## Partial Draft ☑️

In the last two check-ins, you started getting rough ideas on paper as we continued to learn course topics

## Fourth Check-in

For this check-in, as a Word or Powerpoint, cover as many of the following topics as possible:

- **History** of your language
- **Documentation** on your language that is official and easy for beginners
- **Getting Started** instructions, brief but informative, showing someone how to go from zero knowledge to everything they need to install and setup to a working "hello world" example on their own computer (not on repl.it)
- **Data Types** supported by and commonly seen in your language
- **Variables** and how to declare them in your language
- **Conversion** between common data types in your language, like string to int
- **Console I/O** for showing text to the user and getting a response back
- **If/Else** in your language
- **While** loops in your language
- **For** loops in your language
- **Arrays** in your language
- **Functions** in your language
- **Classes** in your language

Some topics we haven't gotten to yet, but we've got to the majority by now.

For each section (Data Types and onward), define the idea as it relates to programming in general, and give an example in your assigned language.

You can have many small examples, one for each section, or the occasional longer example that covers a few sections at a time.

What matters is that, throughout, you give accurate information, you give clear and legible examples, you do so with a well-organized document, and your examples are ones you've written yourself. (Don't just embed screenshots taken straight from w3schools, for example.)

## Submission

Do the check-in above in a Word/Powerpoint/PDF and submit to Blackboard.

This check-in is worth 3/100 towards your final grade.
