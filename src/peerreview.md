# Peer Review Instructions ü§ù

Week 12 (as part of Check-in 5), submit your "like a final" draft to the Peer Review discussion board.

Week 13, give feedback to two people, for 6/100 total, or 3/100 each, towards your final grade.

Weeks 14 and 15 you will consider and implement feedback from your three reviewers (two student reviewers plus me). You will include a page/slide/etc. in your final draft that says how you did/didn't implement their feedback, for 4/100 towards your final grade.

Finally, Week 15 you will submit your for-real-final draft. This is worth 11/100 towards your final grade for a clear and thorough discussion in each of the required document sections, with legible and valid code examples for each where appropriate.

Therefore, the term project will come to a total of 31/100 towards your final grade (all the check-ins, plus the peer review, plus the note about addressing feedback, plus the final draft itself)

# Week 12

Post your term project to the Peer Review discussion board as part of the check-in 5 instructions.

Attach your Word/Powerpoint to your post, or upload your document to OneDrive (kctcs.onedrive.com) and share a link to it here. (Just be sure you enable permissions for us to view your OneDrive files before you post. If we have to ask for permission to view your files, it may incur too much delay, and we'll have to skip over your post entirely. Failure to enable permissions is therefore failure to post your draft at all.)

In your discussion board post:

- Tell us your language
- Include any questions/comments/etc. you have for your reviewers (at least two)

Include these sections in your draft:

- **History** of your language
- **Documentation** on your language that is official and easy for beginners
- **Getting Started** instructions, brief but informative, showing someone how to go from zero knowledge to everything they need to install and setup to a working "hello world" example on their own computer (not on repl.it)
- **Data Types** supported by and commonly seen in your language
- **Variables** and how to declare them in your language
- **Conversion** between common data types in your language, like string to int
- **Console I/O** for showing text to the user and getting a response back
- **If/Else** in your language
- **While** loops in your language
- **For** loops in your language
- **Arrays** in your language
- **Functions** in your language
- **Classes** in your language

# Week 13

Wait until the start of Week 13 to do this, so that everyone's drafts can be ready:

Select two people to review. Select those with the least reviewers so far. Do not select someone with 2 student reviewers already. If possible, select one person with the same language as you and one person with a different language.

Once you have chosen your people to review, leave a comment on their post saying, "I am reviewing you." Do this *first* so it makes clear to the other students who is already working on reviewing who.

Respond by the end of the week with a comment or Word/PDF document with your feedback. Be respectful, professional, and courteous. Try to point to specific examples in their document when giving feedback. Give feedback on the good, the bad, and areas for improvement for:

- What's good and shouldn't change
- The document's coverage of all the topics listed above
- The document's overall structure and clarity of organization via section headings, etc.
- The document's clarity in discussing the importance of those topics to programming in general
- The document's choice of and use of code to illustrate and teach those topics in their language
- The originality, clarity, and usefulness of the document's code examples
- Questions the document leaves you with about their language (even if these questions aren't directly related to the topics listed above)
- Answers to the questions the reviewee had for their reviewers

# Weeks 14 and 15

Final drafts are due the Sunday of Week Fifteen (the week before final's), midnight Eastern time.

Upload your your final draft with all your revisions, plus the following new sections, to the Week Fifteen folder:

- **Introduction** to your project (it's always easiest to write the intro last)
- **Comparison** of your language to other languages we have seen in this course
- **Object Oriented Programming** (classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism) in your language
- **Packages** and how we import them in your language
- **The Future** of Programming (where do you think the future of programming and programming languages is heading?)
- **Notes on Feedback** (what suggestions from me and your peers did you take into consideration when editing your final draft, what changes did you make, and what suggestions did you not make and why?)
