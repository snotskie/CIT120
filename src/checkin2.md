# Project Check-in 2

## Looking Forward ☑️

In the last check-in, you told me your preferences. After that, I assigned you a language and you discussed your check-in with your Studio group.

## Second Check-in

Let me give you more details about the term project. Later in the semester, you can write your primer as a Word document or a Powerpoint presentation.

Whichever format you choose, it should be clear and thorough and cover these topics:

- **History** of your language
- **Documentation** on your language that is official and easy for beginners
- **Getting Started** instructions
- **Data Types** supported by and commonly seen in your language
- **Variables** and how to declare them in your language
- **Conversion** between common data types in your language, like string to int
- **Console I/O** for showing text to the user and getting a response back
- **If/Else** in your language
- **While** loops in your language
- **For** loops in your language
- **Arrays** in your language
- **Functions** in your language
- **Classes** in your language

We'll add a few more sections towards the end of the semester, but that's the large majority of what you'll cover.

So, to help us keep the pace between now and then, for this check-in, answer these questions:

1. Which would you rather do, Word or Powerpoint, and why?
2. What is the primary purpose of your programming language? For example, Julia is a considered *scientific* programming language.
3. How long has your language been around? How many major "revisions" or "versions" has your language been through throughout the years?
4. Apart from the links I've given you, where could a beginner go to learn about your language? This can be a website, a youtube channel, a book, or so on. It's better to pick one *really good* resource than a bunch of mediocre ones, so take some time searching on this. This will also help you support yourself and others in the weeks to come.

## Submission

Do the check-in above in a Word/PDF and submit to Blackboard.

## Grading

Like last time, this check-in is worth 1/100 towards your final grade. The check-ins after this will be worth more.
