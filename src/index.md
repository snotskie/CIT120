# CIT 120: Computational Thinking

Welcome in!

On this site I'll post lessons and assignments for our class. I do this because I share a lot of code examples, and they'll look a *lot* better this way than on BlackBoard. You'll still *submit* work through BlackBoard.

## Why the Change from Glitch?

In the past, I [hosted this course content on Glitch](https://cit120.glitch.me/). That served its purpose well. But every few years I get the itch to rewrite the whole stack from scratch.

Now, I'm generating our course site using Julia. This has all the benefits of Glitch, plus:

- All assignments are listed in the sidebar / menu
- Subsections of assignments are also listed in the sidebar / menu
- The "next" and "previous" assignments are linked at the bottom of every page
- You can choose a light or dark theme (gear icon in the top right)
- You can suggest edits if you catch a typo or find a cool link you think I should share
- You can search the entire site using the search bar in the top left
- Links now open to external sites in new tabs correctly
- And I have *way* less code to maintain

The downside is I'm no longer listing due dates here. Instead, see BlackBoard, the syllabus, or my weekly announcements.

!!! tip

    If you use Google Chrome, [NaturalReader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/naturalreader-ai-text-to/kohfgcgbkjodfcfkcackpagifgbcmimk/) appears to be a decent option for reading our course content out loud. I write a lot for y'all to read. Sometimes having the voice there can help. (If the tool stops working, let me know. I last checked it July 13, 2023.)
