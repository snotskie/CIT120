# Project Check-in 3

## Chipping Away ☑️

In the last check-in, you started a very rough draft for the first few sections of your term project.

## Third Check-in

The best term project submissions are those that give accurate information, clear and legible examples, and are well-organized documents.

Let's answer some questions to help us keep on pace:

1. How could someone making a Word document for this project keep their document organized and easy for someone unfamiliar with it to navigate it?
2. Same as above, but for the Powerpoint folks?
3. Define, in your own words, these terms, as it relates to programs and programming in general (feel free to borrow a bit from what you've written in Labs):
    - Data Types
    - Type Conversion
    - Console Input
    - Console Output
    - Selection (if/else)
4. Create a small program of your own that illustrates how to do the following in your language. The point of this mini-exercise is to start getting an illustrative example together that you've made yourself and that you can use in your project later. (If you've written a program for a Lab/tinker/etc. that accomplishes these things already, feel free to reuse that, just clean it up to make it more legible if need be.) Embed clear, legible screenshots of the code and the result to make sure it works. Your program should show how to:
    - ask the user to input their name
    - ask the user to input three numbers
    - check if their first number is between their second and third numbers

(When you use screenshots of code, be sure to crop down just around the code that we care about so that it isn't scaled down so small we can't read it. And *please* use screenshots. Don't copy and paste your code right into your Word/Powerpoint, since Word/Powerpoint likes to auto-capitalize things and etc., and you'll lose the color-coding.)

## Submission

Do the check-in above in a Word/PDF and submit to Blackboard.

## Grading

This check-in is worth 2/100 towards your final grade.
